Hillary had very little vocal support and had a lot of baggage and trust issues.\\n\\nIf Hillary Clinton had cared about the the good of the party she would not have tried to challenge Bernie Sanders when the writing was on the wall at the convention. (Actually it was clear well before the convention.) I predicted a blood bath at the convention, but the democrats wanted party unity so Bernie was asked not to make a stand. It was clear that he was far more electable. But she carried so much weight in the party that she elbowed Bernie out and ran him home. Why didn\\'t she ask HIM to be her VP? Because of her gigantic pride. He had too much star power and would have out shone her. \\n\\nShe should have done what was best for the party and offered to be VP to Sanders.  Then she could have been the first female vice president That would still be a great thing. Something she could have done and have had as a crowning achievement to her Legacy. Better to be VP than the spoiler who lost the election due to her own greed.\\n\\nBut I would have been afraid for Bernie because I don\\'t trust the Clintons.

She just had to go for the gold. A silver medal would not have been good enough. Living at \"Number One, Observatory Circle\" (the official residence of the Vice President) would not have been good enough. It would have been too great of a step down for her.

There are many people who chose not to learn who the real Donald Trump is. Well I have. The media has torn him apart everyday while editing his rally\\'s speeches for the purpose of a agenda. Trump stands for something more then just a candidate running for president. He couldn\\'t be bought or controlled and that strikes fear throughout our corrupt government to even those such as the owners of most media networks. Politicians We the People thought could be trusted such as the Bushes and Bernie Sanders all bought into our corrupt government. The GOP & DNC establishment are also interconnected in this same corruptive connection. We all have been devastated with this election yet in the end one thing is clear. We CAN NOT let this corrupt money hungry government continue using our country as a get rich quick network. It\\'s draining our economy while taking our jobs and selling them off to the highest pay for play government. Decisions are being made in the name of speaking fees and donations to corrupt politicians instead of what\\'s best for our America. When Trump talks about a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants for the sake of our security until we as a nation can properly vet and background check to stop terrorist from entering our country he is called a racist and bigot. He talks about crimes happening in our country from illegals who shouldn\\'t have been in our country anyway so he is considered a racist. Trump who goes on and on about finally putting Americans first while allowing only the America loving \"dreamers\" use the legal system of citizenship to gain our benefits such as voting. This is the man the media talks about hate when if people would just listen to him he is all about love. Love for our beautiful country, love for our people, and all people no matter your color, nationality or religion. He wants us to be safe and prosper with great jobs and a good economy. He wants us to have a government ran by the people and for the people not by a corrupt establishment. This is important, far more important then any election in the past. The next president will be able to appoint up to 5 Supreme Court justices. This economy can\\'t take any more debt. I remember when we hit 1 trillion in national debt and people thought it was the end of the world. Now we are closing in on nearly 20 trillion and if you think more of the same is going to help I\\'m sorry but your wrong. Donald Trump said he doesn\\'t want to be paid as a president. He said he only wants to give back to his country. In interviews as far back as 1980 he as been worried about the state of our country with the building of corruption within our government. Every time he was asked if he wanted to run for president he said he would rather not. Unfortunately nothing was getting better, he couldn\\'t watch crooked politicians and large companies destroy this country for their own gain anymore. He did something about it and tomorrow we need to do our part. As for how I feel about Donald Trump, win or lose he is a American Hero. He is running for the American people not money, power or to repay international and domestic donors and special interest. One Last time I will ask for people to research him.

They work hard and all chip in on rent and send most of that money back home. So why are you going to cast a vote for this shill pandering to you to turn this, the country that you came to to bankroll being to retire to a ranch or something better than the future you had, why would you trade that in to turn this country into WHERE YOU CAME FROM TO BEGIN WITH!!!\\n\\nI just got done casting my vote for Donald J. Trump. I urge any undocumented person that is going to vote to at the least before pulling that lever, to think about voting for Trump. He can make this country an engine of business and enterprise again. That mean's you get to send money back home again which will be hard to do with a benefit card that is coming in your future.

There are many people who chose not to learn who the real Donald Trump is. Well I have. The media has torn him apart everyday while editing his rally\\'s speeches for the purpose of a agenda. Trump stands for something more then just a candidate running for president. He couldn\\'t be bought or controlled and that strikes fear throughout our corrupt government to even those such as the owners of most media networks. Politicians We the People thought could be trusted such as the Bushes and Bernie Sanders all bought into our corrupt government. The GOP & DNC establishment are also interconnected in this same corruptive connection. We all have been devastated with this election yet in the end one thing is clear. We CAN NOT let this corrupt money hungry government continue using our country as a get rich quick network. It\\'s draining our economy while taking our jobs and selling them off to the highest pay for play government. Decisions are being made in the name of speaking fees and donations to corrupt politicians instead of what\\'s best for our America. When Trump talks about a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants for the sake of our security until we as a nation can properly vet and background check to stop terrorist from entering our country he is called a racist and bigot. He talks about crimes happening in our country from illegals who shouldn\\'t have been in our country anyway so he is considered a racist. Trump who goes on and on about finally putting Americans first while allowing only the America loving \"dreamers\" use the legal system of citizenship to gain our benefits such as voting. This is the man the media talks about hate when if people would just listen to him he is all about love. Love for our beautiful country, love for our people, and all people no matter your color, nationality or religion. He wants us to be safe and prosper with great jobs and a good economy. He wants us to have a government ran by the people and for the people not by a corrupt establishment. This is important, far more important then any election in the past. The next president will be able to appoint up to 5 Supreme Court justices. This economy can\\'t take any more debt. I remember when we hit 1 trillion in national debt and people thought it was the end of the world. Now we are closing in on nearly 20 trillion and if you think more of the same is going to help I\\'m sorry but your wrong. Donald Trump said he doesn\\'t want to be paid as a president. He said he only wants to give back to his country. In interviews as far back as 1980 he as been worried about the state of our country with the building of corruption within our government. Every time he was asked if he wanted to run for president he said he would rather not. Unfortunately nothing was getting better, he couldn\\'t watch crooked politicians and large companies destroy this country for their own gain anymore. He did something about it and tomorrow we need to do our part. As for how I feel about Donald Trump, win or lose he is a American Hero. He is running for the American people not money, power or to repay international and domestic donors and special interest. One Last time I will ask for people to research him.

Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn’t use overt methods requiring Justice Department approvals.\\n\\n“The Justice Department official was “very pissed off,” according to one person close to Mr. McCabe, and pressed him to explain why the FBI was still chasing a matter the department considered dormant. Others said the Justice Department was simply trying to make sure FBI agents were following longstanding policy not to make overt investigative moves that could be seen as trying to influence an election. Those rules discourage investigators from making any such moves before a primary or general election, and, at a minimum, checking with anticorruption prosecutors before doing so.\\n\\n“Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?” Mr. McCabe asked, according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause, the official replied, “Of course not,” these people said.”\\nWhile that may sound like the Obama bureaucrat backed off in his threats, other lower ranking FBI officials believe the Justice Department gave a “stand down” order.\\n\\nThe Journal also reports:\\n\\n“Others further down the FBI chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: “Stand down.” When agents questioned why they weren’t allowed to take more aggressive steps, they said they were told the order had come from the deputy director—Mr. McCabe.”\\nThe investigations into Hillary Clinton have been tainted by dirty politics from day one.\\n\\nObama interfered in the investigation by proclaiming – without evidence and before all the findings were complete – that Hillary Clinton did nothing wrong.\\n\\nAnd when Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton aboard her government airplane, many believed they discussed how Hillary Clinton would not face criminal charges for her behavior.\\n\\nBut as the lid has been peeled off in this story, the level of corruption and amount of pressure put on the FBI not to investigate the Clintons is shocking.\\n\\nIt reveals an administration consumed with the pursuit of power, willing to sacrifice the rule of law and independence of the investigative process to allow their favored candidate to win an election.', 'id': '1110705142383503_1110750822378935'}, {'created_time': '2016-11-07T23:33:02+0000', 'from': {'name': 'Akam K Malla', 'id': '1731046040518785'}, 'message': \"I hope you win madam President.

Latinos are registering in record numbers eager to vote for her. \\n\\nReality check: On November 8, 2016, when Madam Clinton wins the same amount of states as Democrats running for President have won since 1996, she will start Election Day with approximately 242 Electoral College votes. Once she gets 270 Electoral College votes, she will be our President-Elect.  With Trump as the GOP nominee, she will turn previous “red” states like Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, etc., into “blue” states on her way to a landslide Electoral College and popular vote victory. Join the inauguration celebration on January 20, 2017, as Madam Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton becomes the 45th President of the United States. I hope to see you all at the Inaugural and Inaugural balls. I will be the loud Puerto Rican celebrating and waving at the cameras...\", 'id': '1110705142383503_1110964892357528'}, {'created_time': '2016-11-07T22:39:24+0000', 'from': {'name': 'Kimberly Carroll', 'id': '10203037921265004'}, 'message': 'When I grow up, I want to be the 1st Woman to skirt MULTIPLE CRIMINAL FELONIES!!', 'id': '1110705142383503_1110740565713294'}, {'created_time': '2016-11-07T23:25:44+0000', 'from': {'name': 'Marcia Holmes', 'id': '231477413990250'}, 'message': \"Lucinda your disgracing God, he doesn't believe that his children should be aborted.\", 'id': '1110705142383503_1110761279044556'}], 'paging': {'cursors': {'before': 'MTMy', 'after': 'MTA3'}, 'next': 'https://graph.facebook.com/v2.8/747113272076027_1110705142383503/comments?access_token=391936647836699%7CV8Mqw_BZjSgZSQo48uaMUq2cIvI&summary=1&limit=25&after=MTA3'}, 'summary': {'order': 'ranked', 'total_count': 132, 'can_comment': False}}}, {'id': '747113272076027_1110666522387365', 'shares': {'count': 50}, 'created_time': '2016-11-07T20:16:04+0000', 'likes': {'data': [{'id': '279562029141918', 'name': 'Adarsh Sharma'}, {'id': '209756402836073', 'name': 'Erikc Bana'}, {'id': '1318723178166358', 'name': 'Anna JU Myp Ihf'}, {'id': '1906414826254364', 'name': 'Fujio Noguchi'}, {'id': '453298518388403', 'name': 'Prabir Purkait'}, {'id': '742758275900902', 'name': 'Sayed Shahabuden Shahab'}, {'id': '781656021999388', 'name': 'Lucas Gonçalves'}, {'id': '242174756247636', 'name': 'Aurc Afghan Ngo Kandahar'}, {'id': '1443106599035655', 'name': 'Tara Da Silva Pinto'}, {'id': '1263613360360015', 'name': 'Brett Austin'}, {'id': '10155083065614920', 'name': 'David Estrada'}, {'id': '220825088325070', 'name': 'Mirza Salim'}, {'id': '2232401346984276', 'name': 'Angela Aguilar'}, {'id': '10210728744467162', 'name': 'Matthew Carter'}, {'id': '1807468579516271', 'name': 'JT Keyling Miranda'}, {'id': '717774241725687', 'name': 'Rebekka Phillips'}, {'id': '594039617455646', 'name': 'Jose Roberto de Sivla'}, {'id': '1155041634593715', 'name': 'Abdul Jabbar Wako'}, {'id': '375030182880683', 'name': 'John Torres'}, {'id': '746236115544497', 'name': 'Naeem Akhter'}, {'id': '1842917445949562', 'name': 'Joshua-Paul Kostopoulos'}, {'id': '980878982041975', 'name': 'Rony Hasan'}, {'id': '645856482282316', 'name': 'Cheick Amed Tidiane Bangoura'}, {'id': '1138334239628507', 'name': 'Denise Morgan'}, {'id': '1208711482580805', 'name': 'DrZamzam Mustafa'}], 'paging': {'cursors': {'before': 'Mjc5NTYyMDI5MTQxOTE4', 'after': 'MTIwODcxMTQ4MjU4MDgwNQZDZD'}, 'next': 'https://graph.facebook.com/v2.8/747113272076027_1110666522387365/likes?access_token=391936647836699%7CV8Mqw_BZjSgZSQo48uaMUq2cIvI&summary=1&limit=25&after=MTIwODcxMTQ4MjU4MDgwNQZDZD'}, 'summary': {'total_count': 233, 'can_like': False, 'has_liked': False}}, 'comments': {'data': [{'created_time': '2016-11-07T20:22:24+0000', 'from': {'name': 'Aymen Braham', 'id': '977161712420755'}, 'message': 'Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be.

Please post on Facebook the pic of El Donald grabbing the kitties of all the women in your family.\\n\\nPrinceton Election Consortium, Professor Sam Wang, (election.princeton.edu/electoral-college-map), who has been 100% accurate since 2000 in all primaries and all the General Elections, predicts Madame Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton has a 99% likelihood of being elected as the 45th President of the United States.

President Obama won the African-American vote by 93% and the Latino vote by 74%. In this election, Madam Clinton will increase the white vote due to the women's vote, retain the African-American vote and increase the Latino vote substantially on her way to a landslide victory. With Trump as the GOP nominee, millions of Republican women will vote for Madam Clinton. Latinos are registering in record numbers eager to vote for her. \\n\\nReality check: On November 8, 2016, when Madam Clinton wins the same amount of states as Democrats running for President have won since 1996, she will start Election Day with approximately 242 Electoral College votes. Once she gets 270 Electoral College votes, she will be our President-Elect.  With Trump as the GOP nominee, she will turn previous “red” states like Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, etc., into “blue” states on her way to a landslide Electoral College and popular vote victory. Join the inauguration celebration on January 20, 2017, as Madam Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton becomes the 45th President of the United States. I hope to see you all at the Inaugural and Inaugural balls.

President Obama won the African-American vote by 93% and the Latino vote by 74%. In this election, Madam Clinton will increase the white vote due to the women's vote, retain the African-American vote and increase the Latino vote substantially on her way to a landslide victory. With Trump as the GOP nominee, millions of Republican women will vote for Madam Clinton. Latinos are registering in record numbers eager to vote for her. \\n\\nReality check: On November 8, 2016, when Madam Clinton wins the same amount of states as Democrats running for President have won since 1996, she will start Election Day with approximately 242 Electoral College votes. Once she gets 270 Electoral College votes, she will be our President-Elect.  With Trump as the GOP nominee, she will turn previous “red” states like Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, etc., into “blue” states on her way to a landslide Electoral College and popular vote victory.

Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.\\n4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.\\n5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).\\n6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. \\n7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.\\n8.

Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn\\'t arm the missile and the Chinook didn\\'t explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a \"do-or-die\" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn\\'t supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK\\'d the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.\\nCopied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth....\\nAnd it just so happens that Stevens met with the Turkish foreign minister in the days leading up to the attack in Benghazi to ask for permission to move the Stingers through Turkey to the rebels in Syria.

In those few precious minutes of live TV, the nation gets a glimpse of candidates themselves. Fair and square. Mano a mano. Or, so we thought.\\n\\nNot in the case of Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. Newly released emails from Wikileaks show that there was nothing fair or square about her debates against Republican Donald Trump. Rather, Clinton and her campaign folks were committing acts of collusion, as per The Federalist Papers.\\n\\nCollusion – you might not be overly familiar with that word. The dictionary defines it as “secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others.” It often refers to an illegitimate relationship between media owners and political candidates or leaders.\\n\\nIn this case, it refers to CNN’s cooperation with the Clinton campaign in hours prior to the debate. Debate questions that were to be a surprise to the candidates were forwarded in advance to the Clinton camp, the emails show.\\n\\n“From time to time I get the questions in advance,” Donna Brazile originally titled her email. You don’t say. Uh, that’s not just unethical. It happens to be, illegal.\\n\\nIn her reply to Brazile’s email, Alcantara included Clinton’s proposed response to the question, clearly to make sure that she and the CNN moderator are on the same page.\\n\\nYou might call it a dress rehearsal. This is the collusion.\\n\\nCNN, in full damage control mode, is refusing to admit that they knew anything about it, choosing instead to say that Donna Brazile acted alone. In a statement, CNN said they were “completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign.”\\n\\nFurther, they rejected any notion that Brazile had access to the said leaked questions. CNN said they “never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate.”  Please! Do they expect us to believe that? This is like insider trading. It’s getting essential data ahead of your competitor in order to secure an advantage. It’s cheating. Collusion.\\n\\nThe story begs some good questions. If Hillary and her people are so comfortable with the idea of cheating, in what other areas will they cheat? How can they be trusted to lead this country? And, why didn’t they reject the insider information and take “the high road?”\\n\\nLet’s add this up. First, there were email scandals. Then, “pay to play” activities at the Clinton Foundation. And now, collusion. This could keep the Justice Department busy for about a decade. Or, it could be that Hillary might spend her first 100 days pardoning herself.\", 'id': '1108044009316283_1108321579288526'}, {'created_time': '2016-11-06T03:45:50+0000', 'from': {'name': 'Aicrag Hazia', 'id': '1278903452193748'}, 'message': \".\\nWARNING:\\nEXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFORMATION!\\n\\nVoting for Hillary Clinton is basically voting for two persons.\\nThis because Bill who was a president is another brain that can help resolve every conflict at hand.

This means not that there will be no immigrants in the futre from the south. This means only they always have to be legal border crossers.

President Obama won the African-American vote by 93% and the Latino vote by 74%. In this election, Madam Clinton will increase the white vote due to the women's vote, retain the African-American vote and increase the Latino vote substantially on her way to a landslide victory. With Trump as the GOP nominee, millions of Republican women will vote for Madam Clinton. Latinos are registering in record numbers eager to vote for her. \\n\\nReality check: On November 8, 2016, when Madam Clinton wins the same amount of states as Democrats running for President have won since 1996, she will start Election Day with approximately 242 Electoral College votes. Once she gets 270 Electoral College votes, she will be our President-Elect.  With Trump as the GOP nominee, she will turn previous “red” states like Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, etc., into “blue” states on her way to a landslide Electoral College and popular vote victory. Join the inauguration celebration on January 20, 2017, as Madam Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton becomes the 45th President of the United States. I hope to see you all at the Inaugural and Inaugural balls. I will be the loud Puerto Rican celebrating and waving at the cameras...\", 'id': '1107890119331672_1107925259328158'}, {'created_time': '2016-11-06T10:17:51+0000', 'from': {'name': 'Virendra Kumar Tiwari', 'id': '1261265263957500'}, 'message': 'Lucknow, November 6, the US Democratic Party candidate Smt.
